It is located on the south west coast of Thailand in the Andaman Sea and connected to the mainland by the Sarasin Bridge. The currency is the Thai Baht (approx. THB50 to £1; and THB4 to HK$1) and the electricity is 220 Volt. Most of the population is Buddhist.</p>\r\n      <h3>Climate</h3>\r\n      <p>Phuket is hot and humid throughout the year. However November to February is considered the “cool” season with temperatures ranging between 24 to 31 degrees Celsius. While the monsoon season ends in October, there may still be a chance of rain in November, at 175mm on average</p>\r\n      <h3>Traveling in</h3>\r\n      <p>The Phuket International Airport is a compact airport in the north of the island. There are direct flights to Phuket from most cities in Asia, including Beijing, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, KL, Miri and Shanghai. For those of you travelling from UK or US, there is unfortunately no direct flight and you will have to transit either in Bangkok or another international airport.</p>\r\n    <h3>Things to Do:</h3>\r\n    <p>If you are planning to stay in Phuket for a little bit either before or after the wedding, we would recommend the following activities:</p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li><strong>Visit Patong beach</strong><br />\r\n\r\n      <p>Patong beach is located on Phuket’s west coast and it’s famous as Phuket’s centre for nightlife and shopping. The bars are most concentrated in Soi Bangla, Rat U Thit Road and Paradise Complex. At the end of Soi Bangla you will find the mega shopping centre Jungceylon which is the largest and most well-known shopping centre in Phuket. The beach is also worth a visit for its soft, powdery sand, you can also take part in many activities such as parasailing, water skiing and it is also one of the world’s top ten diving spots. If none of these interest you, take a walk along the long beach (3.5km) and look at others taking part in these dangerous activities from a distance – which is what we do.</p></li>\r\n\r\n    <li><strong>Phuket Old Town</strong><br />\r\n\r\n    <p>Nowhere has more personality and culture in Phuket than the Old Town. It is located on the east side of the Island. In this historically rich part of Phuket you can find shrines, temples, old mansions and museums. We particularly recommend a stroll on Thalang Road, lined by ornate, beautifully preserved Sino-Colonial houses which will take you right back through time to a century ago when Phuket flourished from the riches from its tin boom, and here you will get a glimpse of the lives, influences and struggles of Chinese immigrants who made the tin boom possible.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n\r\n    <li>\r\n      <strong>Island excursions</strong><br />\r\n      <p>Phi Phi island and James Bond islands are both beautiful and popular destinations for island excursions. These can be arranged with hotels or private tour operators and if there are enough interests among our guests, we will try and organise private trips. However please be mindful that the sea can be choppy and the boat trip there and back may feel long and exhausting.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n\r\n    <li><strong>Massage &amp; spas</strong><br />\r\n      <p>This is one of our favourite things to do in Thailand. It is the best thing after a long flight or tiring day of exploring Phuket. The prices are very cheap in Thailand compared to elsewhere, you can get a one hour massage for THB300 (£6/HK$80). At the posh end, you can go for the Banyan Tree spa but advance appointments will be required here.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n\r\n    <li><strong>Shopping</strong><br />\r\n\r\n      <p>Perhaps one wouldn’t come to Phuket for the shopping but once you are here you may still be tempted by the large variety of local markets and stalls. There’s no point buying anything you can get from home of course, but the traditional handicrafts, antiques and housewares are definitely worth a look. Thai-made houseware items are known for their unique and creative designs, and are very cheap. We would also recommend a visit to <a href=\"http://www.jimthompson.com/index.asp\">Jim Thompson</a> who is the American businessman famous for introducing Thai silk to the world (and perhaps also for being an American spy-suspect disappearing mysteriously in the Cameron Heights in Malaysia). Jim Thompsons are only available in south-east Asia and they carry beautiful home décor items, scarves and other colourful and Thai-themed clothes and accessories.</p></li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Restaurant Recommendations</h3>\r\n    <ul>\r\n\r\n    <li><strong>Silk at Andara</strong><br />\r\n      <p>At the pricey end but safe bet for great Thai and international food. It is located inside Andara Resort.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n\r\n    <li><strong>The Siam Supper Club</strong><br />\r\n      <p>A great place with intimate and slightly retro ambience, serves Thai and international dishes from a short but refined menu.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n\r\n    <li><strong>Blue Elephant</strong><br />\r\n      <p>Located in Phuket Old Town in a beautiful colonial mansion. They serve traditional Thai food and is considered a fine-dining place.
